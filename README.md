## Motivations:
Money is a big motivator for most people, and everyone likes to save money. Nowadays, there are so many subscription services out there for a plethora of goods and services that it can be hard to keep track of them all. As a result, people can often forget to cancel subscriptions they no longer need and end up paying for them for months or even years after they have stopped using them. Without closely monitoring your transactions, it can be easy to miss these charges and consumers may feel as if their money is vanishing into a black hole.

## Description:
Subify is a web application that allows users to keep track of their subscriptions and their monthly costs. This allows users to have an overview of all their subscriptions and see how much they are spending on a monthly, as well as yearly, basis. The goal is to help users save money by being better aware of what they are spending their money on so they can make more informed decisions about their subscriptions.
